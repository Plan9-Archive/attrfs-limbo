programs to be described:
attrfs
mkaudiodb
wm/pick


todo:
- attrfs: sorting without case is better
- attrfs: test if we don't leak memory, e.g. on clunk the fiddata and fidallpick

- pick: don't show paths in result listbox, but descriptions based on fields, read from file "all"
- pick: allow user to select multiple options from listbox?  needs support from attrfs

testing:
- attrfs: allow pick-file write commands on clone fid that created the pick
- attrfs: fix "leaking" of mp3 attributes to other path-elements
- attrfs: read attributes, indexkeys and mainkey from command-line
- pick: fix behaviour after having clicked on "show" for listbox
- pick: fix selecting type, doesn't work now
- pick: add fixed "show" button
- pick: fix frame with buttons, it is too high
- pick: implement executing commands on double-click (has been done on button3, not double click)
- rename attr to attrfs
- pick: isolate namespace, for chdir
- pick: when new listbox gets one entry, simulate a select on that as well

done:
